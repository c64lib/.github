## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find set of useful KickAssembler libraries for native Commodore 64 development as well as a few supporting tools.

Temporary and incomplete documentation for libraries: https://c64lib.github.io/docu/. This will change soon, I hope.

A backbone build system that I wrote, maintain and use myself is pretty well docummented: https://c64lib.github.io/gradle-retro-assembler-plugin/.

There are few examples of using both libs and the tooling on my private space: https://github.com/maciejmalecki/, including:

* https://github.com/maciejmalecki/trex64/
